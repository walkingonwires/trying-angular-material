# Angular Material Sample

I threw together a page using material's grid list.
It have it dynamically generating the sizes and colors. 
The tile titles come via an http call to some lorem ipsum.

To Run:

install node packages

> npm install

install bower packages

> bower install

**IMPORTANT - from the app folder create sym link to bower_components**

> cd app/

> ln -s ../bower_components/ bower_link

to run call 

> gulp serve
